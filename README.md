# Arbitrage App

Arbitrage App is a web application to find [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage)
opportunities in a financial market where assets are traded with one another, e.g. 
[Forex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market). This app is for
learning purposes and is not suitable for real-world trading.

It consumes currency exchange rates from [](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
and builds an edge-weighted digraph where the currencies are vertices, and the
edges are [currency pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_pair) weighted
by the exchange rate.

The idea was inspired by the arbitrage example in
[Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and
Kevin Wayne.
